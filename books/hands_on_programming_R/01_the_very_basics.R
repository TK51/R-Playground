#### The Very Basics ----

# clean the slate and start from the clear page
rm(list = ls())

# Working directory

setwd("/home/t51/DataAnalytics/R-Playground/books/hands_on_programming_R")

# having an interval
10:31

name <- "a"
name

## Making a die (dies)
# make a vector, a one-dimensional set of numbers
1:6

# creating an object named "die"
die <- 1:6
die

# check all the created object names within the environment
ls()

# play with the die
die - 1
die / 2
die * die

1:2
die + 1:2

1:4
die + 1:4

# matrix inner multiplication (with %*%)
die %*% die

# matrix outer multiplication (with %o%)
die %o% die

# basic functins - round and factorial
round(3.1567)  # 3
factorial(3)   # 6

# function logic - from innermost to the outermost
mean(1:6)  # 3.5

mean(die)  # 3.5

round(mean(die))  # 4

# you can simulate a roll of the die with Râ€™s sample function, takes 2 args -
# a vector named x and a number named size.
sample(x = 1:6, size = 2)  # 2 5 or 1 3 or 2 3

# roll a die by setting x = die and size = 1 (as one element to be rolled)
sample(x = die, size = 1)
