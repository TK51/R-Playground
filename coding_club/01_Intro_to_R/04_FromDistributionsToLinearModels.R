#### FROM DISTRIBUTIONS TO LINEAR MODELS ----
# GETTING COMFORTABLE WITH THE BASICS OF STATISTICS MODELLING

#### Tutorial Aims & Steps:
# 1. Get familiar with different data distributions
# 2. Choosing your model structure
# 3. Practice linear models (and ANOVAs)
# --- Write and run the models
# --- Understand the outputs
# --- Verify the assumptions
# 4. Practice generalized linear models
# 5. Challenge yourself!

#### 1. Data distribution types ----

### Get familiar with different data distributions
# Here is a brief summary of the data distributions you might encounter most often.

# -- Gaussian - Continuous data (normal distribution and homoscedasticity assumed)
# -- Poisson - Count abundance data (integer values, zero-inflated data, left-skewed data)
# -- Binomial - Binary variables (TRUE/FALSE, 0/1, presence/absence data)

# Continuous - Gaussian, Discrete - Poisson, Binary - Binomial
