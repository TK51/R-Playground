#### FROM DISTRIBUTIONS TO LINEAR MODELS ----
# GETTING COMFORTABLE WITH THE BASICS OF STATISTICS MODELLING


# 1. Learn base R syntax for data manipulation:
# --- logical operators for finer control
# --- creating and assigning objects
# --- specifying factors
# 2. Turn messy data into tidy data with tidyr
# 3. Use efficient tools from the dplyr package to manipulate data

# Tutorial Aims & Steps:
# 1. Get familiar with different data distributions
# 2. Choosing your model structure
# 3. Practice linear models (and ANOVAs)
# --- Write and run the models
# --- Understand the outputs
# --- Verify the assumptions
# 4. Practice generalized linear models
# 5. Challenge yourself!
