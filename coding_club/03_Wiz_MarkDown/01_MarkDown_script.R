#### Description ----
# Tutorial AIMS:
# 1. Understand what RMarkdown is and why you should use it
# 2. Learn how to construct an RMarkdown file
# 3. Export an RMarkdown file into many file formats
# Tutorial STEPS
# 1. What is RMarkdown
# 2. Download RMarkdown
# 3. Create an RMarkdown (.Rmd) file
# 4. YAML header material
# 5. Markdown syntax
# 6. Insert code from an R script into a .Rmd file
# 7. Create a .pdf file from your .Rmd file
# 8. R Notebooks (the future of reproducible code? Maybe?)

# clean the slate and start from the clear page
rm(list = ls())

#### Libraries ----
#install.packages("rmarkdown")          # - if you're missing one
library(rmarkdown)

#### Working directory ----
# Set working directory
getwd()
setwd("./03_Wiz_MarkDown")

#### 1. What is RMarkdown ----
# Markdown is a very simple ‘markup’ language which provides methods for 
# creating documents with headers, images, links etc. from plain text files, 
# while keeping the original plain text file easy to read. You can convert 
# Markdown documents to many other file types like .html or .pdf to display 
# the headers, images etc.

# 2. Download RMarkdown ----
#install.packages("rmarkdown")          # - if you're missing one

# 3. Create an RMarkdown (.Rmd) file ----
# To create a new RMarkdown file (.Rmd), select File -> New File -> R Markdown..._ 
# in RStudio, then choose the file type you want to create. For now we will 
# focus on a .html Document, which can be easily converted to other file types later.

# The newly created .Rmd file comes with basic instructions, but we want to 
# create our own RMarkdown script, so go ahead and delete everything in the 
# example file.

# Now open the RMarkdown_Tutorial.R practice script from the repository you 
# downloaded earlier in another tab in RStudio and use the instructions below to 
# help you convert this script into a coherent RMarkdown document, bit by bit.



# 4. YAML header material
# 5. Markdown syntax
# 6. Insert code from an R script into a .Rmd file
# 7. Create a .pdf file from your .Rmd file
# 8. R Notebooks (the future of reproducible code? Maybe?)
